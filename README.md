# AZURE_VNET
In this Azure project, you have set up a multi-region network architecture by building multiple Virtual Networks (VNets) in three distinct geographical regions. These VNets allow you to segment and isolate your resources while also facilitating secure and efficient communication between Virtual Machines (VMs) in different regions.

To connect VMs across regions, you have established Virtual Network Peering or Azure VPN Gateway connections between the VNets. Virtual Network Peering enables seamless and low-latency communication between VMs located in separate VNets, ensuring that they can exchange data and workloads effortlessly. The Azure VPN Gateway, on the other hand, provides a secure and encrypted connection, ideal for extending your on-premises network to Azure resources or connecting VMs securely.

This multi-region VNet setup enhances your application's resilience, improves performance, and ensures geographic redundancy. It's a fundamental step in building a scalable and highly available cloud infrastructure while enabling geographically distributed teams or services to work together seamlessly.
